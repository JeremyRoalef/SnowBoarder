SnowBoarder is a 2D snow boarding game where the objective is to reach the goal post. This game and repository is being revisited to expand upon the core gameplay loop and implement programming techniques I learned throughout the years. This includes:

1) Refactored code for legibility, expandability, and proper logic handling.

2) Scene, visual, and audio management.

3) Redesigning of gameplay structure in Unity editor.

The goal of these changes are simply to expand on the content given while remaining true to the original game. By the end of the changes, Snowbaorder will have a core gameplay loop, proper scene handling, proper logic, and other features deemed fit for the game.

For reference, here is what one of the scenes looks like:
